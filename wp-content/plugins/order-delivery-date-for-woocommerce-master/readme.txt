Allow the customers to choose an order delivery date on the checkout page for Woocommerce store owners.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow the customer to choose an order delivery date on the checkout page. The customer can choose any delivery date that is after the current date. The plugin uses the inbuilt datepicker that comes with WordPress.

The plugin allows the site administrator to select delivery weekdays, specify minimum delivery time and display number of dates on calendar. The delivery date also shows in a column on Woocommerce > Orders page.

The 'Mandatory field?' setting will allow the Delivery Date field to be set as mandatory on the checkout page.
